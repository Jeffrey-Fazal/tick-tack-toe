2. Create base HTML elements and DOM structure
3. Break project into smaller parts
   1. HTML/CSS design - barebones
   2. JS: Think about the setup, storing variables etc
      1. Add event listeners to each part of the grid
      2. Create a  simple script to alternate between tick and toe icons
      3. Make the underlying logic that you can't click on a grid that has already been played
      4. Identifying a win and loose condition.
      5. Show win or loose
   3. Time to get fancy. Add extra features including: 
      1. Win counter
      2. Audio for clicking stuff and win/loose
      3. Reset
      4. Toggle between human and cpu
      5. Sound toggle
      6. Count down timer
      7. Changing the board (expanding grid and custom avatars)
