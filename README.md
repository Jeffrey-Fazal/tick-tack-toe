2. Create basic game logic in js
   1. Create an array to store the data
   2. Find a way to output the data nicely 
   3. 
3. Create base HTML elements and DOM structure
4. Break project into smaller parts
   1. **HTML/CSS design** - barebones
   2. **Java Script** Think about the setup, storing variables etc
      1. Add event listeners to each part of the grid
      2. Create a  simple script to alternate between tick and toe icons
      3. Make the underlying logic that you can't click on a grid that has already been played
      4. Identifying a win and loose condition.
      5. Show win or loose
   3. **Goals**
      1. Win counter
      2. Higlight the grid that is about to be played
      3. Animate the cpu last move (shake the token) 
      4. Audio for clicking stuff and win/loose
      5. Reset
      6. Toggle between human and cpu
      7. Sound toggle
      8. Count down timer
      9. Changing the board (expanding grid and custom avatars)
      10. Document code code with JS code
